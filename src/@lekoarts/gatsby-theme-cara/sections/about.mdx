## About
- Although I worked both frontend and backend side, and devops too. But if you ask me where is place you most confident, my answer is backend and devops side.
That's right, I love UI/UX, love all beautiful thing. But love and most great field is not same thing.
All my passion is relate about backend and devops field, You need a detail for most I great?
  - Kubernetes:  When I start work with K8S, I think this technology will change all traditional infrastruture, It's so hard, but it's worthy to learn.
Many thing have to learn when you was started with K8S. But actually now in some JD in company, I can't see this technology is a major skill need. I think this technology
have many thing to learn for create high avaibility system. If you looking for some people have a dirty hand with this technology and around technology like helm...vv... I think you can contact me for discussion if you need me.
  - Site Reliability Role: No, It's not a technology like ReactJS library, K8S, or programming language, It's just a title I think most fit with me and towards to. As a SRE, not only I work with system or process of devops role, but also a developer.
I think the engineer who can write code, follow and develop together with team and deploy can be know clearly about system.
Bug can appear from many side, frontend site, backend site, or env, or process of deployment. I stand for between these side, and when have trouble, I can determine quickly which side cause error.
I think beyond thing to combine with another team, I very happy when I can understand and feeling sorry with hard of many side in development process. And can together fix and explain issue to make system growth day by day
  - Nodejs: My first programming language I start with, both Typescript too, easy to learn but difficult to master. I love it so much, whatever the first background of my journey is Nodejs backend developer, ehehe.
  - Google Cloud Flatform: This is the first cloud provider I started with, I still continue learn for my solution architecture certificate I attend to.
